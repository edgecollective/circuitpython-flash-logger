## Description

This firmware for basic datalogging to SPI flash memory on CircuitPython Express board.  Only Feather M0 Express has been tested.

## Requirements

This firmware requires that a recent version of the [circuitpython UF2 master branch](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/commits/master), which allows for filesystem remount via [storage.remount()](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared-bindings/storage/__init__.html), be installed.  Instructions below for how to do this for the Feather M0 Express board.

This particular setup also requires using a simple switch to toggle the state of an IO pin on the board.  A through-hole 10K resistor can be used for this purpose.

## Feather M0 Express Installation Instructions

(All code below comes from the "feather_m0_express" directory in this github repo.)

### Connect the Feather M0 Express to your laptop

Plug the Feather M0 Express into a USB port.  A USB drive will appear as CIRCUITPY.  Ignore this for now. 

### Install UF2

- Double-press the reset button in order to enter into bootloader mode.  A USB drive will appear on your desktop as "FEATHERBOOT". 
- Copy the .uf2 file into FEATHERBOOT. 

### Install the firmware

- Now single-press the reset button.  A USB drive will appear on your desktop as "CIRCUITPY".
- Copy "boot.py" and "code.py" into CIRCUITPY.
